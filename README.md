ACF4 is extremely similar to Acf4p genes. While its function is currently unknown, it may have a role in actin cytoskeleton organization and it is a potential Cdc28p substrate. When I used tblastn I found that some of the saccharomyces cerevisiae genes was very similar to ACF4. Using blastn I learned that there is no significant similarity between ACF4 and the human genome.
